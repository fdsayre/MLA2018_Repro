		<h2>Reproducibility Guidelines & The Reporting Of Science</h2>

			<aside class="notes"> 
So hello, My name is Franklin Sayre, I’m the pharmacy librarian at the University of Minnesota, before that I worked with public health and graduate medicine at UBC, in Vancouver, Canada.
I started looking at issues around the reproducibility of study results around 3 years ago. My interest is really two fold. On one hand I did a history and philosophy of science program and I'm interested in issues to do with epistemology, methodology, and scientific norms. On the other hand I work with health science researchers and professional students -- students who will go on to be clinicians and use research in patient care.

	<h1 style="color:Tomato;">How I learned to stop worrying and love the reproducibility crisis</h1>
		<aside class="notes">
So this is what I really wanted to call this presentation. In part because I think the so-called "crisis" in reproducibility is actually an incredible opportunity for those of us who advocate for transparency in scientific research because it ties transparency directly to the, for lack of a better word, "truth" of scientific studies.

Before I get started I need to mention that most of the work represented in this presentation is the result of collaboration with my colleague Amy Reigelman, the Social Science librarian at UMN. Amy and I have two recent papers, this editorial in C&RL on librarian roles supporting reproducibility

		<aside class="notes">
And a second paper that is in press and should be available in the next month or two, also in C&RL, on replicable services for reproducibile research, that presents a broad model for how we can address the recommendations in reproducibility guidelines.

	<h2>Take-aways</h2>
	
	<p class="fragment fade-in">1. Reproducibility is, to a large degree, the work of academic librarians.</em></p>
	<p class="fragment fade-up">2. Data curation and sharing, broadly defined, is a major part of reproducibility guidelines.</p>
	<p class="fragment fade-up">3. Reproducibility is not a component of data management. Data management is a component of reproducibility.</p>

<aside class="notes">
Three takeaways
1. I think the following guidelines demonstrate that many, if not most (by raw number if not importance) recommendations relate to core areas -- citation, data sharing, publications -- of academic librarianship
2. Data, creation, curation, and sharing, broadly defined, is an essential part of reproducibility.
3. Reproducibility guidelines -- and the role academic librarians can play in improving reproducibilty -- is much wider than data management. I've heard a lot of people day that Repro is itself just a component of DM. I want to convince you that it's an opportunity. We need to engage liaisons and others in the work of repro and vice versa. There is a danger that by thinking of the libraries contribution to repro as just being DM and sharing, we miss opportunities.

<aside class="notes">
First, quick definitions. These definitions come from NSF report. Definitions for reproducibility and replicability vary and often conflict between sources.

	### Replicability
	
	> “the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but <em style="color:Tomato;">new data are collected</em>.”

<aside class="notes">

This is distinguished from replicability, which is the ability to duplicate (not necessarily exactly) the results while gathering new data. Replicability goes further than reproducibility, and in many ways relies on the same things as reproducibility.

	<h2 style="color:Tomato;">Why Academic Librarians and Reproducibility?</h2>

<aside class="notes">
While talking with faculty I've needed to be proactive about addressing what is an obvious and I think reasonable question many of them have: Why me? Why is a librarian talking to them about reproducibility? 

We’re not researchers. Or, actually, we are, but our research tends to be about how people use and organize information. I’m totally comfortable talking about methods and reproducibility of systematic reviews, or bibliometric research, but when I think about research I tend to think about it in terms of how it is structured, organized, made available, and a little about how it is evaluated. I tend to think about research in terms of how it is reported or packaged.

	<h2 style="color:Tomato;">Guidelines</h2>

<aside class="notes">

Okay, So: Reproducibility Guidelines, much like treatment guidelines, are generally consensus statements of best practices towards the goal of improving the reproducibility of results. Again, we really like centering our discussion on guidelines because they (a) come from researchers and publishers themselves, and (b) demonstrate some of the commonalities and differences between disciplines and organizations.

Just want to mention that we are only looking at 3 guidelines here (TOP, ASA, NIH). There are MANY more guidelines, incuding from funders, journals, and for specific disciplines, methodologies, research areas, and even conferences. Amy and I are currently working on a research project that tries to make these easier to find and use, so if you’re interested in guideliens for your specific area please get in touch with us

### TOP (Transparency and Openness Prom	otion) Guidelines
	</textarea>

<aside class="notes">

So, first I’m going to talk about the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines. The TOP guidelines were developed by a group of scientists, journal editors, and open science advocates and are meant to be adopted by journals. They are a flexible set of 9 criteria that can adopted at various levels of enforcement in order to meet disciplinary norms and goals. As of October of last year  Over 5,000* journals and organizations have become signatories to the TOP Guidelines, including all Elsevier journals.

While they are meant to be adopted by journals, once they are fully implemented they have significant affects of researchers.

	### American Statistical Association (ASA) Guidelines
<aside class="notes">

Next, the American Statistical Association Guidelines. ASA has been doing really interesting work on Reproducibility

Repro editors, include Julian Wolfson in Public Health
Victoria Stodden is another repro editor

These are meant for funders and represent ASAs interest, but we think are interesting in a number of ways for how they are similar to and different from the TOP guidelines and NIH recommendations
